# Animals

Picture yourself in the Savannah!

1. Define an `Animal` with an `initialize(name)` constructor, exposing its `name`.

2. Define three `Lion`, `Meerkat` and `Warthog` classes.

3. Implement a `#talk` instance method which returns a sentence like `"Simba roars"` for each animal. (Hint: Meerkats bark and Warthog grunt)

4. In another Ruby file, create an array with Simba, Nala, Timon & Pumbaa, iterate over it and `puts` the sound each animal make

5. Implement a `::phyla` **class** method which will return an array of the [phyla](https://  toppr.com/guides/biology/diversity-in-living-organisms/animal-kingdom/#The_Different_Phyla) of the animal kingdom.

6. Add an `#eat(food)` instance method in `Animal` which returns a sentence like “Timon eats a scorpion”. Then **override** this method for the Lion class, and return a sentence like “Simba eats a gazelle. Law of the Jungle!”
